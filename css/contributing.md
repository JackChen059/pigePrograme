The project is essentially finished. The goal is to mirror Eric Meyer's CSS Reset with only minor tweaks. There are so many other CSS Resets that diverge with wildly different goals and opinions; this is not one of them.



I will accept PRs only to keep this repo current with Eric's upstream reset.
